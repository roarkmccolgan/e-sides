<p>According to data provided by the World Economic Forum, despite internet users claiming to have read a privacy policy, only about 20% actually do. This is primarily linked to the fact that policies are usually long and difficult to comprehend: to address this issue, researchers from the Federal Institute of Technology at Lausanne, Switzerland (EPFL), the University of Wisconsin, and the University of Michigan developed Polisis (short for “privacy policy analysis”), a machine-learning AI able to read the privacy policy of any website inside a minute. Furthermore, Polisis can provide users with a readable summary of the policy, a flow chart of what exactly is going to be shared and where that information will be used, as well as information regarding opting out of information sharing. The developers also created Pribot, a chatbot able to provide answers on any privacy policy for free.
