<p>Dr. Google is an algorithm using health records to predict hospital patient outcomes and claiming to be 95% accurate.
</p>
<p>A team of computer scientists and medical experts from Google and three major U.S. universities recently announced they have developed an AI-based software able to do a better job at predicting patient outcomes than any other methods currently available. To make its predictions, the software relies on medical-records data including patient demographics, previous diagnoses and procedures, lab results and vital signs. In particular, the software claims to be able to predict patient deaths 24/48 hours before current methods, which could increase the possibility for doctors to implement life-saving procedures and avoid them .
