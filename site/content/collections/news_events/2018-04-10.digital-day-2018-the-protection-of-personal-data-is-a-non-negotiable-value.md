<p>This is one of the key messages launched by Mariya Gabriel, the European Commissioner in charge of Digital Economy and Society, during the “Paving the way for the EU Artificial Intelligence Initiative” press conference, held in Brussels at the Digital Day 2018 (10 April). During her speech, the Commissioner underlined the importance of personal data protection, privacy and citizens’ trust, without which it would be impossible to achieve positive results in the framework of the digital transformation. This is also why, according to Gabriel, all the initiatives the European Commission is currently working on, ranging from e-health to blockchain, are based on the principles of transparency, responsibility and privacy. At the same time, she clarified that the EU approach based on values and privacy is not in contradiction with platforms’ capability to foster growth, innovation and employment, which, however, should be developed in a responsible way.

<p>The Digital Day 2018, organised by the European Commission under the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, has constituted an important occasion in order to bring together high-level stakeholders in the fields of digital technology and telecommunication. During the event, 25 EU countries have signed a declaration of cooperation on AI, while 22 countries have signed a declaration to establish a European Blockchain Partnership, vital to start experiments and test applications for the people’s good on large scale.
