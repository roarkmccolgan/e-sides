<p>Interesting presentations on the themes of data economy, data localization, GDPR and cybersecurity were held on 31/01 at the Data Economy Conference in Budapest organized by the H2020 Eudeco Project. Among them, the keynote speech held by Gabriella Cattaneo from IDC, e-SIDES coordinator, focused on how the power of data will drive the economy. During her presentation, Cattaneo explored the potential development paths of the European data economy to 2025 through alternative scenarios, leveraging on IDC’s forecast models developed on behalf of the European Commission. According to latest IDC data, the European data market is expected to more than double in value by 2025 reaching up to 147 B€: this will obviously generate induced and indirect positive impacts on the economy but will also pose new challenges for organizations and individuals.

<p><span></span>The benefits and risks deriving from the free flow of data and the new GDPR rules were at the center of the speech held by Cecilia Bonefeld-Dahl from DigitalEurope, who focused on the issue of government access to personal data and posed the question of how to guarantee security without undermining the European data economy. Apart from citizens and governments, GDPR will also affect companies: an interesting insight into how the new rules will affect business was given by Dr. Bálint Tóásó from KPMG Legal Tóásó Ügyvédi Iroda, who stressed the main internal and external changes companies will face. Ethics, privacy and compliance, on the other hand, were issues tackled by Ákos Deliága from Talkabot, who shared practical experience and use cases on chatbots.
