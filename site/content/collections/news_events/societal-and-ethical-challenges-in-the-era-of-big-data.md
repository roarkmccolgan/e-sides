<h5>Background</h5>
<p>The initial work of the e-SIDES project has been twofold. On one hand, e-SIDES has focused on promotion activities such as awareness raising, community building and stocktaking, including the activation of the online platform <a href="http://www.e-SIDES.eu">www.e-SIDES.eu</a> and two community events: the first of these events was the Turin Workshop held on June 7.
</p>
<p>On the other, the technical team has mapped a long list of ethical and societal implications of big data technologies through an exhaustive desk research and in-depth literature review.
</p>
<p>The Turin workshop was the first validation tool to assess the initial results reached at this phase. e-SIDES workshop entitled “Societal and Ethical Challenges in the Era of Big Data: <i>Exploring the emerging issues and opportunities of big data management and analytic</i>” took place in the University of Turin, Turin, Italy on June 7, 2017 as part of the CEPE/Ethicomp 2017 “Values in Emerging Science and Technology” Conference.

<p>The audience consisted mainly of academia representatives (professors, researchers and students), and representatives from government-led research initiatives.
</p>
<h4>Day Overview and Discussions

<p>The workshop presented a set of interactive sessions by means of a combination of presentations, live voting tools and discussions, which made the workshop highly dynamic and interesting. Each presentation was followed by a voting session and elaborated discussions of the voted results, feeding into productive interactions and dialogue.
