<p><a href="http://cyberwatching.eu/"><strong>Cyberwatching.eu</strong></a> is a project funded under the European Commission's H2020 Programme with the aim to establish an European observatory of research and innovation in the field of cybersecurity and privacy. Coordinated by <strong>Trust-IT</strong>, experts in communication & marketing for ICT and cybersecurity & privacy, the project also includes a variety of partners active in the cybersecurity and privacy domain: the <strong>University of Oxford’s eResearch Centre</strong>, <strong>ICT Legal</strong>, the <strong>Digital SME Alliance</strong>, <strong>CONCEPTIVITY</strong>, the Spanish cyber-cluster <strong>AEI Ciberseguridad</strong>, and the cyberinsurance professionals <strong>AON</strong>. <br>
</p>
<p>Since the topics addressed by the project are particularly in line with the activities carried out by e-SIDES, the two projects have recently started to collaborate and exchange results.
</p>
