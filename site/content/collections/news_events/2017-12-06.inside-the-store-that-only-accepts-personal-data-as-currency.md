<h5>Would you give up some of your personal data, like screenshots of your WhatsApp, SMS and emails to buy the latest shoes in town? The global cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab has decided to carry out an experiment to test you.</h5>
<p>The Data Dollar Store is definitely an unusual pop-up shop in London where you can find exclusive t-shirts, mugs and screen prints that you can only buy by giving up some personal data. For the mug, you have to hand over three photos / screenshots of your WhatsApp, SMS or email conversations, for the t-shirt, it has to be the last three photos on your Camera Roll or the last three messages on your phone. For the original print from street artist Ben Eine you should even hand over your phone, allowing staff to freely select five photos or three screenshots.
