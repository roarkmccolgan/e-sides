e-SIDES is an **EU-funded Coordination and Support Action** (CSA) that will complement the Research and Innovation Actions (RIAs) of the **ICT-18 call on privacy-preserving big data technologies** by exploring the societal and ethical implications of big data technologies and providing a broad basis and wider context to** validate privacy-preserving technologies**.

> The principal scope of e-SIDES is to: 

_**1**_ - Involve the complete value chain of big data stakeholders to reach a common vision for an ethically sound approach to big data processing.

_**2**_ - Improve the dialogue between data subjects and big data communities (industry, research, policy makers, regulators) and, thereby, to improve the confidence of citizens towards big data technologies and data markets.
